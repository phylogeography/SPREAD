SPREAD is a Java program supporting processing and visualizations of BEAST's phylogeographic models ("BEAST software":http://beast.bio.ed.ac.uk/Main_Page). 

Contains visualisations (templates), wrapped in a user friendly interface. Supported visualisations include embedded Processing applets and KML output for viewing in "Google Earth":http://www.google.com/earth or any other virtual globe software capable of reading the format.

A tutorial on using SPREAD is availiable "here":http://www.kuleuven.be/aidslab/phylogeography/tutorial/spread_tutorial.html
